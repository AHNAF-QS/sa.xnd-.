        <p class="year">The year is 2242.</p>

        <p>
            The neon glow of Neo-Kyoto dripped like digital rain on the slick, deserted streets.  A lone figure, Kenshin, moved through the shadows, his cybernetic arm gleaming faintly. He was the last Ronin, a ghost in the machine-city, haunted by the memory of a fallen clan.
        </p>

        <p>
            His city, once a cradle of technological marvel, was now a cage controlled by the Iron Syndicate.  They had crushed all resistance, their enforcers, emotionless automatons of steel and wire, patrolling the avenues.
        </p>

        <p>
            Kenshin carried with him the <span class="highlight">ancestral katana</span>, its edge undimmed by time, a stark contrast to the energy blades of his enemies.  He was a relic, a whisper of the old ways in a world that had forgotten honor.
        </p>

        <p>
           One night, he found a hidden message, a flicker of rebellion in the network.  A small band of hackers, calling themselves the Ghost Circuits, sought to break the Syndicate's hold.  They needed a warrior, a blade in the darkness.
        </p>

        <p>
            Kenshin, guided by a fading sense of duty, joined them.  He moved like a wraith, the katana singing its deadly song in the narrow back alleys and across the shimmering skyscrapers.  He was their shadow, their edge, the whisper of hope in a city of despair.
        </p>

        <p>
            The final confrontation took place at the Syndicate's heart, a fortress of glass and steel.  Kenshin, with the Ghost Circuits at his back, faced the leader, a cyborg of terrifying power.  The battle was a clash of eras, of flesh and steel, of the old ways against the new.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the end, Kenshin stood alone.  The katana, bathed in the city's dying light, struck the final blow.  The Syndicate's control shattered, like glass against steel.  The city was silent, then a cheer rose, faint at first, then a roar.  The Ronin had returned.
